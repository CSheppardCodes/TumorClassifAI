# TumorClassifAI
python AI project that learned and predicted if a tumor was benign or malicious based on parameters in the data. 


# Description
Coded a python AI project that learned and predicted if a tumor was benign or
malicious based on medical data.
1. Imported the data from a medically recorded dataset for tumors in the
form of a .csv file.
2. Utilized Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow Keras sequential model, and
Google Collab.
3. Used a sigmoid activation function to guarantee an output of 1 or 0 (either
benign or malicious) and Adam Optimizer to train the neural network in
less time and more efficiently.
4. Results: Binary cross entropy loss value of 0.2095 and accuracy of
92.98%
